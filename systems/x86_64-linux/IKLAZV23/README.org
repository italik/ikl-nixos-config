* Disk Configuration
Two disks are attached to the virtual machine. A 32GB image and a 1024GB image:

** SDA (32GB)
This disk contains 3 partitions:

| Number | Label | Size | Filesystem | Mount |
|--------+-------+------+------------+-------|
|      1 | BOOT  | 2G   | vfat       | /boot |
|      2 | swap  | 4G   | swap       | swap  |
|      3 | nix   | 26G  | ext4       | /nix  |


** SDC (1024GB)
This disk contains 1 partition:

| Number | Label | Size  | Filesystem | Mount |
|--------+-------+-------+------------+-------|
|      1 | data  | 1024G | ext4       | /data |

* Initial Data Partition Setup
A few files need to be created in /data before the system can be used. Assuming the data partition is mounted at /mnt/data use the following commands (Comments are defined with a # and don't need to be entered):
#+begin_src bash
mkdir /mnt/data/secrets
# SSH Host Keys. Do not enter a password
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /mnt/data/secrets/ssh_host_rsa_key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /mnt/data/secrets/ssh_host_ed25519_key
# User passwords. Use a secure password and save in password manager
mkpasswd > /mnt/data/secrets/root
mkpasswd > /mnt/data/secrets/italik
chmod 400 /mnt/data/secrets/root /mnt/data/secrets/italik
# AGE keys for secrets
nix-shell -p age --run "age-keygen -o /mnt/data/secrets/age-keys.txt"
# Save the public key shown on the screen to .sops.nix at this repo's root
#+end_src
